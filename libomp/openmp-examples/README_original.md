# openmp-examples
This repository contains OpenMP-examples which I created while learning OpenMP. 

I follow Tim Mattson's [Introduction to OpenMP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE-xN4Bf8XI&list=PLLX-Q6B8xqZ8n8bwjGdzBJ25X2utwnoEG) video playlist on youtube.

### Details
I am learning OpenMP because I have a master degree program assignment about running machine learning algorithms in parallel. 

In addition to OpenMP, I am going to do same things by using Apache Spark. In summary, this is quite a personal playground repository. 
It does not mean to cover all the details or become a comprehensible tutorial guide.
