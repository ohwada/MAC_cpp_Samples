### overview
Combo Boxes  
The ComboBox widgets offers a list (or tree) of choices in a dropdown menu. If appropriate, it can show extra information about each item, such as text, a picture, a checkbox, or a progress bar.   
The ComboBox widget usually restricts the user to the available choices, but it can optionally have an Entry, allowing the user to enter arbitrary text if the none of the available choices are suitable.
