May 23, 2001 - October 5, 2001


2001.10.05
  Bug Fixes:
    * Added "input" windowmanager hint and title, so program will appear in
      VRSM window lists (VR->Windows menu, and Statusbar app windowlist).
      This works around a current bug in VRSM.

2001.09.04
  Documentation:
    * REAMDE.txt fleshed out some
  Code:
    * Makefile can now build Agenda SNOW binary (does by default).
  Bug Fixes:
    * Player doesn't start out in a wall in the medium-sized maze any more.
    * Removed ".xvpics/" subdirectory from "images/" directory.
    * Added "strlen.h" include.
  Tweaks:
    * Outline of entire maze shown in hidden-maze-view modes.
    * Cursor (within map) made more obvious.
    * Window opens right after program starts, and shows "Loading" meter.


2001.05.31
  Bug Fixes:
    * Game would end immediately when playing with "Up" counter.  Oops!
    * Exit position was off by one.  Oops!
    * "Don't face a wall in the beginning" code fixed. (x/y swapped; oops!)
  Features:
    * Added Sound On/Off button to game screen.
  Tweaks:
    * "Build" is now default map mode when you start the program
    * Your position on the map flashes
    * Map area has a background (mainly for build mode)

2001.05.30
  Features:
    * A goal!  Start in the middle, get out at the upper left of the maze.
    * Game ends if timer counts to zero
  Bug Fixes:
    * "Build" mode map drawing works better
    * Sound values returned when program quits
    * Timer counts real seconds
  Tweaks:
    * Fewer (unseen) wall chunks drawn; rendering faster, hence game faster!
    * "Generating Map" image not displayed (no point; you never see it!)
    * Images converted to true Agenda 16 grey palette

2001.05.24
  Bug Fixes:
    * Debugging code removed from maze generation function
      (most notably, the system() call to "clear" the screen. ACK!)
    * Redraw code removed from event handling loop
    * Removed an ".xvpics" image thumbnail directory (oops!)
    * Movement code moved outside of event loop (no more going through walls!)
    * Maze code fixed ('j' shouldn't have changed randomly in one spot)
  Features:
    * Added "Done" button
    * Added walking sound effects / changed bumping sound effect
    * Added stylus/mouse control
    * Started work on the timer
    * Screen "scrolls" when you turn around
    * Title screen, with options controls
    * Different maze sizes
    * Different map modes (show all, build as you go, and show nothing)
    * Timer modes (count how long it takes, or count-down timer)
  Documentation:
    * README.txt updated

2001.05.23
  * Initial release
