  * Fixed paddle movement so that it also can go off
    the screen when using the keyboard
  * Fixed paddle so that it can't move faster with mouse than
    with keyboard
  * Paddle changed so that it has seven areas for adding
    slope to the ball.  The new ball angle is now determined
    by both the paddle hit location and the previous ball 
    slope
  * Ball speed corrected so that it moves at the same speed
    no matter which angle it is moving
  * Turned on Launch button after level is completed
  * Fixed problem where ball was leaving a hole in the middle
    of the new level after a level was completed
  * Ball now launches closer to the X location of the paddle
  * Brick collisions are detected correctly.  There are a 
    few quirks especially around the corners, but they can
    be ignored without disrupting the game
  * The ball now speeds up much more gradually as it hits
    the top of the playing field.
  * Ball counter now updates when a ball is lost
  * Added one more level
