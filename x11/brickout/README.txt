About
-----
  "Brick Out" is based on the classic arcade game "Breakout."
  The objective is to clear a screen of bricks by bouncing a ball against
  them.  You use a paddle to bounce the ball, and keep it on the screen.


Title Screen
------------
  When you first launch the game, you'll be presented with the title screen.
  It has the following control buttons on it:

    Start - Start a new game.
    Cont  - Continue a paused game (if applicable).

    Done  - Quits "Brick Out."

    Speaker - Tap this icon to toggle audio controls.  If the icon is
              brighter (and there are lines shooting out of the speaker),
              sound is enabled.  If it is dark, no sounds will be played.


Game Screen
-----------
  The game screen is split into three sections:

    * Game area
      Rows of bricks appear at the top.
      Your paddle appears at the bottom.
      The ball bounces around here.

    * Status area
      This displays your current score, number of balls left, and the
      level you are on.

    * Controls
      The following button controls are provided:

        Pause  - Pause the game (return to title screen).
