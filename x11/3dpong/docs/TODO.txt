* Make a Windows version (insanely high-demand, I guess?!)

* Use a better sound system

* Don't use X-Window for 'networking'  (ouch; that'll be hard!)

* Save handball high-score to a file (e.g., "~/.3dpong-high" or...?)

* Parse command-line options more sanely (allow mixing up order of options)

* Default to try and use local $DISPLAY if no display server args given

* Consider porting to OpenGL and/or libSDL

* Improve graphics/fonts
