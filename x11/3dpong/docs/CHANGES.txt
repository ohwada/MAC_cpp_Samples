  * Version 0.5 - April 28, 2004
    Made command-line options "--longoption"-style.
    Added "--help" option to show usage.
    Manual page contributed.
    Changed references to "server" (as in X11 server) to "display"; less ambig.
    Created "docs" subdirectory for documentation.
    Split credits, changes and installation stuff out of Readme.
    Created a basic TODO.txt.
    Renamed "makefile" to "Makefile", and cleaned up.
    Created "examples" subfolder; brought back example scripts.
    Renamed demo scripts ("go" and "handball") to 3dpong-*.sh.
    Added "$*" to arguments in demo scripts (so you can, e.g., add "-sound")
    Added "install" and "uninstall" targets for makefile.

  * Version 0.4 - May 10, 2001
    Added a copy of GPL (COPYING.txt)
    Removed shell scripts

  * Version 0.3 - January 26, 1998
    "ftime()" function calls changed to "gettimeofday()" function calls
      (for portability)
    A "DOUBLE_BUFFER" constant has been definied.  If set to "True",
      double-buffering (backbuffering) will be used.  (As in v.0.2)
      BUT, this sometimes breaks the program ("Can't create Pixmap" error
      and abort), so you can set it to "False" to turn double-buffering off.
      (As in v.0.0 and v.0.1)  There may be some flicker, though, but at
      least it will run.
    Better documentation.

  * Version 0.2 - December 15, 1997
    Tested under RedHat Linux.
    Added simple /dev/audio sound support.  (Sounds from "xboing.")
    Added clickless mouse control for the paddles.
    Made the default (#define'd) window size bigger.
    The sparks were turned into actual 3D lines (looks 1000x better!)
    A net was added.
    The game now uses a backbuffer. (I may turn this into an option, as
      it seems to go a tad slower.)
    A few tweaks here and there.
    Red/blue mode has the colors reversed (someone told me red is usually
      on the left, not the right).

  * Version 0.1 - December 11, 1997
    Added "free view", "follow the ball" and "follow the paddle" mode.
    Added ball angle control using the paddle.
    Added "sparks" (or "debris") when the ball hits walls/etc.

  * Version 0.0 - December 10, 1997
    First release
